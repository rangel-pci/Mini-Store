## üí° About <a name = "about"></a>
As the name suggests, just a small and simple store (and sort of a database-less application).<br>
When visiting Stripe's website, I became curious about how its API worked. So I decided to combine the useful with pleasant, integrating its payment API and in the process, improve some skills such as TS+Node and TS+Vue, as well as learning new tools such as Tailwind CSS.

- Features
  - Products data are stored in Stripe
  - Mobile-Friendly
  - PWA
  - Webhooks (At the moment, only for payment confirmation event. ü´†)
- Stripe Testing Card <a name = "stripe_testing_card"></a>
  - You can use this card to test the application under development or at [MiniStore.rangelpereira.com](https://ministore.rangelpereira.com/)<br>

## üèÅ Getting Started / Setup<a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will set the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Use /frontend/.env.example & /backend/.env.example to set up your environment.

### Backend Prerequisites
1. Stripe secret key
2. Stripe endpoint secret key (if you want to use webhooks)
3. To make webhooks work on development env, it is necessary to use [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/test).
4. Make sure that your products are in this format within Stripe.

```json
{
  "id": "generated_by_strip",
  "name": "name",
  "images": ["image_url"],
  "metadata": {
  "description_en": "description.",
  "description_pt": "description.",
  "maximum_brl": "25000",
  "maximum_usd": "5000",
  "minimum_brl": "1399",
  "minimum_usd": "269",
  "title_en": "product title",
  "title_pt": "product title",
  "total_raised_brl": "0",
  "total_raised_usd": "0",
  "total_sold": "0"
  }
}
```
5. Now you can follow [these steps](https://github.com/rangel-pci/Mini-Store/blob/master/backend/README.md) to get the server running.

### Frontend Prerequisites
1. Stripe public key
5. Now you can follow [these steps](https://github.com/rangel-pci/Mini-Store/blob/master/frontend/README.md) to get the client running.

## üìù Final Thoughts <a name = "Final_Thoughts"></a>
- The Stripe service has a limit on the number of requests per second, which can ruin the user experience and even bring the system down if the application has a high volume of traffic.<br> Considering this, a solution that comes to mind and that I plan to study and implement in the future would be storing products in cache and updating them every 30/60 seconds, possibly using Redis.
- Well, at the moment the application doesn't use any database, but obviously in a real scenario where the level of complexity increases and the data structure must follow a business rule, a storage solution beyond Stripe would be necessary.
